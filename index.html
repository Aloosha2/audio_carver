            <p>The seam carving algorithm was first introduced in 2007 for content-aware image resizing.
                The algorithm calculates "seams" in either the vertical or horizontal direction to be "carved out".
                Repeatedly carving these seams will reduce the image size while preserving content that is deemed
                important through the algorithm.</p>
            <p>The motivation behind my work is to apply the seam carving algorithm to audio samples and remove content
                that is deemed unnecessary. This may be applied in both the vertical and horizontal context in an audio sample,
                translating to time and frequency domains. Example audio samples are below.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 30px">Approach</h3>
            <p>The audio files that I worked with are in the format of .wav. The idea was to convert the .wav files
                to the time domain and apply the Short-Time Fourier Transform to convert to the frequency domain. With this,
                the magnitude and phase could be extracted and used for seam carving. The seam carving algorithm is ran on the magnitude array
                where the smallest-weight paths are chosen to be deleted. Simultaneously, the same seams are deleted in phase array. Once the
                chosen amount of seams are carved, the magnitude and phase arrays are multiplied (mag*e^(j*phase)) to reconstruct the complex spectrogram.
                The Inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform creates the resulting time domain array to be converted back to a .wav file.
                This algorithm can be used on various formats audio as long as there is a 2d array to work with. For example, some other variations
                that I tested on was the power density spectrogram, power log spectrogram, and the MFCC representation for just the image of the spectrogram.
